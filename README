## Ataraxia
> Ataraxia is a pixel-art game that combines farming management, character-driven adventure, and philosophical dialogue, set in a seemingly peaceful but deeply controlled digital utopia.

## Project Overview
> In this world, the sun always shines and residents are well taken care of‚Äîeverything appears ideal. However, as players engage in conversations, complete quests, farm, and fight, a deeper truth gradually unfolds:  
  In this closed-loop system governed by *shinx*, dreams are erased as threats, and freedom is redefined as obedient illusion.  
  The peace on the surface is, in fact, a fragile illusion paid for with the price of humanity.  
  Ataraxia utilizes nonlinear storytelling, interactive dialogue, and minimalist pixel visuals to create a digital playground filled with ethical and philosophical dilemmas. Players are not just caretakers‚Äîthey are explorers and skeptics.
